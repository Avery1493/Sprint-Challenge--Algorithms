#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) The runtime grows at the same rate for each input. a become n^3.


b) O(n log n) The algorithm has to loop through each input, but the runtime is slightly decreased each time because j increases by two. 


c) O(n) For each bunny, 3 is added.
